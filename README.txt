Repository for random questions

For  list_manip.py :
    I've included my solution as well as the schools solution. 
    My solution seems to get the right answers but with the wrong formatting - extra parenthesis.

Also for python importing:
    Why import individual functions instead of the whole module. Is it due to memory/ run time?
